We want to help you succeed in your job or internship search! That is why Scarlet Data Studio has a special model: we do not select interns until the end of the semester, that way we can provide resources to help you find a job or internship elsewhere before the summer arrives.

If your search is successful, you can get an offer from another program even before the semester ends! And if despite all your efforts you are not able to get another internship, you will still have a chance to join Scarlet Data Studio.

## Job Search Skills

Here are some skills that are very valuable in your job search:

- **Identifying appropriate job postings**
- Connecting with alumni and professionals
- **Revising your resume**
- Developing personal projects
- Practicing for behavioral interviews
- **Practicing for technical interviews**
- Asking questions to evaluate organizations
- Negotiating offers

If you are just starting out your job search, we recommend you focus on the three skills in bold. Use these self-study resources to learn more:
