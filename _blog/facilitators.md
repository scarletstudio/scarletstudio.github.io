# Seeking Facilitators for a Virtual Software Engineering Internship!

Do you want to help Illinois Tech students grow as software engineers and improve your own engineering leadership skills? We are looking for facilitators to manage teams of student interns in a new, virtual software engineering internship.

Scarlet Data Studio is partnering with GlobalShala to offer a virtual internship for Illinois Tech students who want to try out software engineering. Interns will work in teams of four to build the backend for an app for runners. Each intern will implement, test, and design backend features.

Facilitators will manage up to two teams, for a total of 4-8 students. As a facilitator, you will act as the tech lead for these engineering teams: pointing them in the right direction to launch their features, coaching them on how to improve, and stretching your own engineering leadership skills.
