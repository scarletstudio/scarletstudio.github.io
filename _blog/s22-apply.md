**Scarlet Data Studio** is a paid opportunity for underrepresented Illinois Tech students to work on a six-week software engineering internship with professional alumni mentors.

We designed this program for you to get paid to do work in your field of study, gain experience to help with your job search, and connect with alumni who can advocate for you.

Last summer we hosted ten students, you can [read more about their projects here](../blog/s21-projects). This summer will be our third cohort.

If you are interested in participating, please fill out [this interest form]({{ page.apply_link }}){:target="_blank"} before April 4th, 2022. There are no interviews, we will select students who we think will benefit the most from the program. Contact Vinesh Kannan (v@hawk.iit.edu) if you have any questions.

Scarlet Data Studio is not the only opportunity out there for students interested in software engineering. Once you apply, we will share resources with you to help you search for other roles that match your interests. We hope you find the best role for you!

## Program Overview

### About You

The program is for current Illinois Tech students, in any major. Experience outside of coursework is not required, as we will meet students where they are.

You will be well-prepared for this program if you:

- Are interested in software engineering, coding, and/or software engineering
- Feel comfortable coding in Python

If you have any of these **optional** additional skills that will help us pick a project for you:

- Some exposure to data structures and algorithms
- Some exposure to coding in SQL
- Some exposure to coding in JavaScript

### Mentors

All the mentors are Illinois Tech alumni who work professionally in software engineering. We will introduce you to the project, pair program with you, answer your questions, and support you in your career development. We are excited to work with you and help you get to the next level!

### Compensation

Each intern be paid $1,800, for a rate of $30 per hour for 60 hours total.

### Learning Outcomes

- You will read and understand code in a large codebase
- You will use Python to implement new features in a digital product
- You will learn to write unit tests, conduct code reviews, and do pair programming
- You will start your next job/internship search with a resume review, mock interview, career chat, and personal blog post describing your contributions

### Projects

Our team will be building a digital product that is yet to be announced. Each mentor will serve as the tech lead for a part of the codebase and each intern will take ownership of an important feature.

Each intern will complete three projects during the internship, the first two are assigned to you:

1. **Starter Project:** a small code change that can be completed in one pull request
2. **Core Project:** a new feature you will launch that has already been scoped out
3. **Stretch Project:** a new idea you scope out with your mentor to grow in an area of interest

### Schedule

The internship will run from Monday, June 27<sup>th</sup> to Friday, August 5<sup>th</sup>.

Interns work ten hours per week on a flexible schedule. We match mentors with interns who have similar availability to make it easier to schedule 1:1 meetings.

Here are the general milestones for interns:

- **Week 1:** Complete onboarding, merge first pull request, understand core project
- **Week 2:** Make progress on core project
- **Week 3:** Launch core project, get feedback from a real user
- **Week 4:** Improve core project based on feedback
- **Week 5:** Scope a stretch project and start working on it
- **Week 6:** Complete stretch project and present your contributions
