# Seeking Tech Leads for a Virtual Internship!

**Note:** Unfortunately, we will not be running this specific program in summer 2022, but plan to launch it next year. If you are interested in becoming a tech lead, feel free to fill out the form below.

Do you want to help Illinois Tech students grow as software engineers and improve your own engineering leadership skills? We are looking for tech leads to manage teams of student interns in a new, virtual software engineering internship.

Scarlet Data Studio is partnering with GlobalShala to offer a virtual internship for Illinois Tech students who want to try out software engineering. Interns will work in teams of four to build the backend for an app for runners. Each intern will implement, test, and design backend features.

Tech leads will manage up to two teams, for a total of 4-8 students. As a tech lead, you will support these engineering teams by pointing them in the right direction to launch their features, coaching them on how to improve, and stretching your own engineering leadership skills.

Illinois Tech students who have some experience related to software engineering would be great candidates for this role. Our team of alumni software engineers will coach you on ways to grow in your own career. Read the details below to learn about the responsibilities and recommended skills.
